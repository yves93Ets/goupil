This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Changes

Got it ‚Äî you're right: **[https://linear.app/](https://linear.app/)** is a _fantastic benchmark_ ‚Äî clean, fast, and modern without being overwhelming.

### ‚ö° Quick Take on [https://www.habitatnueva.com/](https://www.habitatnueva.com/)

- ‚úÖ It already has clean branding and calm color palette.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But it's a bit dated visually (layout, typography, and spacing feel early-2010s).
- ‚ùå No scroll animations or modern interactions.
- üñºÔ∏è Imagery is good, but could be bigger, crisper, and better used (hero image especially).

---

### üîß Upgrade Strategy Inspired by Linear.app

Here‚Äôs how you could modernize it without overcomplicating:

---

#### üß± 1. **Simplify Layout**

- **Full-width sections** with generous padding.
- Use 2‚Äì3 columns max in most places (no tight grids).
- **One strong CTA per section** ‚Äî avoid cluttered link blocks.

---

#### ü™û 2. **Big Hero Section**

- Remove the small nav image slider ‚Äî replace with:

  - 1 bold statement (what Habitat Nueva is about)
  - 1 crisp photo (interior or exterior)
  - 1 clear CTA (e.g., _Contactez-nous_, _D√©couvrez nos projets_)

---

#### üé® 3. **Modern Typography**

- Use a variable font or a geometric sans-serif (like **Inter**, **General Sans**, or **Space Grotesk**).
- Go big on headings, keep body text \~16‚Äì18px.
- Use lots of whitespace to let the text breathe.

---

#### ‚ú® 4. **Scroll Animation + Microinteractions**

- Fade/slide elements in on scroll (`framer-motion` or CSS).
- Add button hover states with scale or color shift.
- Use sticky nav and maybe a subtle scroll progress bar.

---

#### üì± 5. **Fully Responsive + Mobile First**

- Hamburger menu with nice slide-in panel.
- Mobile-friendly CTA buttons.
- Touch gestures for image carousels (if kept).

---

#### üñºÔ∏è 6. **Image Strategy**

- Use **big, high-quality photos** for each project.
- Consider a **lightbox modal** for gallery images.
- Avoid overuse of carousels ‚Äî use stacked layout or horizontal scroll for a more modern feel.

---

#### üåô 7. **Optional: Light/Dark Toggle**

- Trendy and surprisingly simple to implement now with Tailwind or Chakra UI.
